# Art-A-Level-Websites

Used Wordpress to display multiple digital artwork pieces which depicted the topic of humanity's relationship with technology. 
The website was not intended to be particularly interactive, as it was only intended to be displayed in my sketchbook as a screenshot.

However, I had fun messing around with Wordpress. I made this in April 2019.

Also see link to my Art A-Level Essay, "The Significance of the Gesture when using Technology as a Medium in Art":

The clunky, basic layout of the website was a stylistic choice, inspired by Mark Amerika's GRAMMATRON (https://www.grammatron.com/index2.html), another piece written about in the essay and one I am a particular fan of.

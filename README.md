# Art-A-Level-Websites

Used Wordpress to display multiple digital artwork pieces which depicted the topic of humanity's relationship with technology. 
The website was not intended to be particularly interactive, as it was only intended to be displayed in my sketchbook as a screenshot.

However, I had fun messing around with Wordpress. I made this in April 2019.
